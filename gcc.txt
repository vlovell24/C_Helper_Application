						-- HOW TO RUN AND INSTALL GCC IN WINDOWS --

In this file: Section 1 -> INSTALLATION
			  Section 2 -> COMPILING FILES

										**** SECTION ONE ****

Go to https://nuwen.net/mingw.html
Click on C++ at the top of the page (The link is MinGW Distro)
In the Download Section below, click on "mingw-18.0.exe"

Install this file in your C: home directory (meaning make sure it goes there when you are installing it.)
Once installed, we need to set the Path variable.
On your PC, click the windows key + x
In the menu that pops up, click on system
Click on Advanced System Settings (it's on the far right on my PC)
In the popup click Environmental Variables
In the popup, look for the System Variables section. Scroll down to where it says Path.
Click on Path. Then click Edit.
In the new popup, tyhpe the following: C:\MinGW\bin (you can also copy/paste your bin path here)
Click ok
Ok out of all the popups
Restart your terminal
Type gcc --version
This should say something like: gcc (GCC) 11.2.0
BOOM DONE!!!!

**A note on path variables. Many programs will set the path variable for you, but many don't. If you
type nameofprogram --version in your terminal, and it cannot find the program, the path variable is 
probably not set. Find the programs .bat or .exe file and copy the path to that file. Then open the 
environmental variables (see above) and smack that path into the path variable section. You will notice 
that there are system and user variables. System applies to anyone using the PC. User applies to the 
user logged into the PC. Lets say your PC has several user profiles. Thank you for watching my TED
Talk**

									**** SECTION TWO ****

USING GCC IN THE COMMAND LINE

create a directory to save your ca nd h files in.
cd into that new directoryI use notepad++ for writing quick files, but you can use vim or notepad, or whatever.
		**To use notepad++ type:
		start notepad++ nameoffile.c (you can do the same with notepad.)

		**If using VIM type:
		vim nameoffile.c

Type all your words n stuff. Then hit Control + S to save the file.

Go back to your terminal and type:
gcc nameoffile.c -o nameoffile

Make sure you use the -o nameoffile or the compiler will name your file .a (this is annoying)
Now your file is compiled and you can type:
nameoffile.exe or just nameoffile

This will run the program. If you had errors, the compiler will yell at you and tell you to fix them.

Creating a .h file is exactly the same. Create it, compile it with the -o nameoffile addition and then
compile the corresponding .c file that links to it. Then run the program.

YAAAAAAAAAAY...............YOU DID IT!!!!!

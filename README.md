# :exclamation: The C Helper Application :exclamation:

If I haven't made it abundantly clear in my previous repo's, I love making GUI's. C is kind of gross in 
that I cannot really make a GUI the way I would prefer, unless I want to go the native Windows route. And,
I don't. Not yet. 
Also, I have a cool command line. I almost used Comic Sans. If not for making my >> look weird, it would have happened!!!!

This program is a command line C helper application.

Did Jerry with his fancy macbook tell you that you weren't a 'real' developer because you don't use Linux? Did you 
want to maybe secretly set up a virtual environment so that you could see if Linux was actually worth knowing?

Did you forget all the different escape sequences because you only use the Hex one like once every decade? Oh no:open_mouth:.....

## :interrobang: But Why Val? Why did you do this thing?

Because C can be fun when it isn't all gobbly gook. And, sometimes I just got to refresh my C stuff without creating an 
application that can shoot marshmallows to the moon just to test it. Sometimes I just want to take it easy. Enjoy :hearts:
